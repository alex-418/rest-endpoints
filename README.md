## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Why do I need this plugin? ###

If you installed a plugin or theme that registered a custom content type for you without enabling it's REST API endpoint, then this plugin is for you!  

### Why wouldn't I just enable REST API support on the other plugin/theme? ###

Modifying a plugin or theme you did not write can be time consuming, and can lead to issues such as losing the ability to update the plugin.
